This is a popular plugin for Minecraft servers (over 50,000 downloads) that has sadly been unsupported for a while; I've updated it to Minecraft 1.18 and will be supporting future versions!

If you're looking for plugin support, you can ping me on my Discord server: https://discord.gg/fGzb73sPmV

Picture Login provides a much nicer login message by displaying a picture of the player's head inside of chat.
